# Scripts Directory Guide

The `scripts` directory contains various utility scripts and modules essential to different parts of the project. Each script serves a specific purpose, either aiding in backend calculations, frontend visualizations, or other tasks. Here's a brief overview of each script:

## 1. [calculate_input.py](./calculate_input.py)
This script is designed for the backend. It encompasses functions and routines that compute all the necessary values feeding into the visualizations on the frontend. By processing and aggregating data, it ensures that the frontend receives well-structured and meaningful information for display.

## 2. [js_snippet.py](./js_snippet.py)
Targeted for the frontend, this script generates all the necessary JavaScript (JS) snippets to produce the visualizations. It's a bridge between the raw or processed data and the interactive visual components seen by the end-users. By translating data insights into visual code, it plays a crucial role in the data representation process.

Each script is well-documented with comments to guide developers and data scientists through their functionalities and usage. As the project evolves, additional scripts may be added to this directory to enhance or expand its capabilities.
